### Project overview:
## Total time:
22 hours

## Period:
3-4-2017 to 6-4-2017

## Experience prior to the project:
No javascript experience (only worked with typescript before)
No react experience
Little css experience

## Experience after the project:
Medium javascript experience
Basic react experience
Some css experience

## Final note:
React was a simple, but not easy to work with, javascript library. 
As someone comming from strongly-type language such as Java, C, and currently Swift, javascript is difficult to work with. 
React, it is highly ineffience so far when compare coding time with result. Ionic2 + Angular 2 perform much better.

### Developing guide:
 Follow https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app to create the create-react-app template for the application
 Download or clonse the repo to your desktop
 Open your favourite code editor, open terminal, locate to the directory of the newly downloaded file

 Type in terminal npm start

### Developer logs:
## 3-4-2017

# What have you done? (materials etc. you have read, exercises and other experiments you have done, etc. )
Do research on React using https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html, build data model for the test, build random generate feature, build form and form
validation feature

# What have you learned?
Basics of react: props, state, lifecycle, .jsx, how to set up a basic project

# What topics have been hard for you?
Understanding how data from children can get to parent, if the data flow is uinidirectional

# What were interesting subject matters?
Concept of unidirectional, have not seen this before

# Anything you would like to hear more in depth?
The state is not really clear in the doc, need to do more research on state + how data 'flow up'

# Did you help anyone or did anyone help you and in what way?
Beside the doc, no

# Aprox time spent: 
5 hours

## 4-4-2017
# (School project day)

## 5-4-2017
# What have you done? (materials etc. you have read, exercises and other experiments you have done, etc. )
Do research on state, find new guide on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE&t=2686s, follow the tutorial, build the tutorial, study the tutorial code,
think about how to implement to the test

# What have you learned?
Pratical way of using props and states, how to lift state up, how data 'flow up', how condition render work, fat arrow syntax in javascript, some other ES6 syntax,
'this' in javascript (it's
different from other language)

# What topics have been hard for you?
Digesting everthing in short amount of time. Also, 'this' concept is not really clear, syntax of ES6 is still unfamiliar. React is very basic, need to do everthing
by hand, not really convience

# What were interesting subject matters?
The state and prop work well to move data around, effective, fast, easy to understand and test

# Anything you would like to hear more in depth?
Need to do more research on how 'this' work

# Did you help anyone or did anyone help you and in what way?
Asked my teacher, which redirect me to a fourth year student, we discuss, he gave me links to study

# Aprox time spent: 
6 hours

## 6-4-2017
# What have you done? (materials etc. you have read, exercises and other experiments you have done, etc. )
Build complete project (logic + styling), convert nordsoft logo in to vector, design css structure for the style

# What have you learned?
How to implement state, props into real project, how to structure a typical react project, how HTML's table works (never used before), how to style table, how flex-box
work

# What topics have been hard for you?
Connecting the dots have been a hustle, still unfamiliar with using props and states, styling table was difficult due to lack of experience

# What were interesting subject matters?
Nothing, pure coding

# Anything you would like to hear more in depth?
How react native can help eliviate many problems that currently facing (too much work for too little effect)

# Did you help anyone or did anyone help you and in what way?
Do research on flex box: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/, do research on table: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp

# Aprox time spent: 
11 hours
